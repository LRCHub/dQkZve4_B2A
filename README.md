```lrc
[00:07.93] My baby, my baby
[00:13.17] You're my baby, say it to me
[00:20.47] Baby, my baby
[00:24.85] Tell your baby that I'm your baby
[00:41.35] 
[00:30.86] I bet on losing dogs
[00:36.96] I know they're losing and I'll pay for my place
[00:41.75] By the ring
[00:42.96] Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
[00:48.22] I'll be there on their side
[00:55.19] I'm losing by their side
[01:07.19] 
[01:29.33] Will you let me, baby, lose
[01:38.65] On losing dogs
[01:42.74] I know they're losing and I'll pay for my place
[01:47.58] By the ring
[01:49.03] Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
[02:15.53] 
[01:54.12] I wanna feel it
[01:59.94] I bet on losing dogs
[02:06.20] I always want you when I'm finally fine
[02:10.98] How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I come
[02:17.18] Someone to watch me die
[02:24.52] Someone to watch me die
[02:30.33] I bet on losing dogs
